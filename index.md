I am a PhD student at the [Computational Biology Group](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg) at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering of ETH Zürich. I am generally interested in analysing large data sets using statistical models. More specifically, in my research I develop Bayesian models to extract information from large-​scale single-​cell sequencing data and reconstruct the evolution of tumors.

Before joining ETH Zürich in 2019, I obtained an integrated Master's degree in electrical engineering at the [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, with a major in telecommunications and decision systems. My thesis was about probabilistic matrix factorisation models for scRNA-seq data analysis with [Susana Vinga](http://web.ist.utl.pt/susanavinga/) and [Alexandra M. Carvalho](http://www.lx.it.pt/~asmc/). During my studies, I took software engineering internships at [Jungle AI](https://www.jungle.ai/) and [Pentaho](https://www.hitachivantara.com/en-us/products/data-management-analytics.html).
