title: About
---

I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Princeton University where I am advised by Barbara Engelhardt and work in the Engelhardt Group. I also collaborate with Ryan Adams in the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems. My interests are broadly in machine learning and statistics, and my current work focuses on practical algorithms for scalable and flexible Bayesian inference, such as fast online inference in memory-constrained environments and nonlinear latent variable modeling.

Before Princeton, I earned a B.Arch and M.Arch from Oklahoma State University and Yale University respectively. Bootstrapping a career in science and tech, I worked for Yongli Zhang at Yale, taught myself programming on nights and weekends, and worked as a software engineer for Integral Ad Science and Avi Ma'ayan before pursuing a PhD. In the summer of 2019, I interned as quantitative researcher building fast online algorithms for Tudor in London.
